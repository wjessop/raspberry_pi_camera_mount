# Camera mount for raspberry pi

Front and back pieces. The mounting rails are spaced for meccano nuts and bolts. The round hole on the front panel should fit the popular iPhone lenses available on eBay, I'm using a wide angle lens, but the dimentions might need tweaking, I had to file out a little of the material to get the lens to fit. Front/back bolt holes are m2 I think.

## Issues
